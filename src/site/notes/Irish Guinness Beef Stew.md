# Ingredients
- 2 Medium Yellow Onions
- 3 Cloves Garlic
- 1 (3 lb) Boneless Beef Chuck Roast
- 2 Tsp Kosher Salt
- 1/2 Tsp Black Pepper
- 2 Tbsp Vegetable Oil
- 1/3 Cup All-Purpose Flour
- 2 Tbsp Tomato Paste
- 1 (11-12 Oz) Bottle of Guinness Irish Stout
- 3 Cups Beef Broth
- 1 Tbsp Worcestershire Sauce
- 1 Tsp Dried Thyme
- 1 Bay Leaf
- 5 Large Carrots (1 1/2 lbs Total)
- 1 lb Baby Yukon Gold Potatoes
- 3 Sprigs Fresh Parsley

# Instructions
- Cut 2 medium yellow onions into large dice & mince 3 garlic cloves.
- Trim excess fat from beef chuck, then cut into roughly 2-inch cubes. Pat dry & season with 1 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp of black pepper.
- Heat 1 tbsp of the vegetable oil in a Dutch oven over medium-high heat until shimmering. Add half of the beef in a single layer & brown on all sides. Transfer to a large bowl and repeat for the remaining beef.
- Reduce heat to medium & add the remaining 1 tbsp of vegetable oil. Add the onions and cook, stirring occasionally until softened (about 3 minutes). Add the garlic & cook until fragrant (about 30 seconds). Add 1/3 cup of all-purpose flour & 2 tbsp tomato paste. Stir to coat the onions until no dry pockets remain. Cook for 1 minute. Pour in the Guinness and use a wooden spoon to scrape the brown bits from the bottom of the pot. Simmer, stirring occasionally until the mixture is thickened & the beer is reduced by about half (about 2-3 minutes).
- Add 3 cups of beef broth, 1 tbsp Worcestershire sauce, 1 tsp 1 tsp dried thyme, & 1 bay leaf. Stir to combine. Return the beef & any accumulated juices to the pot. Increase the heat to high & return to a boil. Reduce the heat to low to maintain a bare simmer. Cover & cook until the beef is very tender (about 2 hours). When the beef is almost ready, peel & cut 5 large carrots crosswise into 1-inch pieces, halving the bigger pieces lengthwise. Halve 1 pound baby Yukon Gold potatoes. Pick & finely chop the leaves from 3 sprigs fresh parsley. 
- Add the carrots & potatoes to the stew & stir to combine. Cover & simmer until knife tender (about 30 minutes). Spoon off any excess fat from the surface of the stew. Ladle the stew into bowls & garnish with parsley!
